### In this project we can find two things.

1. Using machine learning models and data about **insider trading information**, **analyst earnings estimations** and **analyst recommendations**, try to **predict** a trend if a given stock will move upward (**Buy**) or downward (**Sell**) in the following months.
2. A **chat bot** that answers questions about **10-K documents** of companies, using **_GraphRAG_** for processing the documents and _o1-mini from OpenAI_ for generating and finalizing the responses.
