### In this project we can find two things.

1. Using machine learning models and data about insider trading information, analyst earnings estimations andanalyst recommendations try to predict a trend if the stock will move upward (Buy) or downward (Sell) in the following months.
2. A chat bot that answers questions about 10-K documents of companies, using GraphRAG for processing the documents and o1-mini from OpenAI for generating and finalizing the responses.
